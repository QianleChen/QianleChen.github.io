Throughout my four years of high school, music has been an integral part of my life, serving as both a creative outlet and a platform for community service. I've dedicated approximately 7 hours per week, 40 weeks per year to various musical pursuits and leadership roles.

## Harmony Sounds Outreach

### Founder and President

I founded **Harmony Sounds Outreach**, a student-led initiative dedicated to bringing the joy of music to elderly community members. As Founder and President, I:

- Established and led the organization from the ground up
- Organized regular performances at senior centers and retirement communities
- Successfully raised over **$1,000** to support our outreach activities
- Coordinated with local venues and community partners
- Built a team of dedicated student musicians committed to service

The experience of connecting with elderly audiences through music has been incredibly rewarding, teaching me about leadership, community engagement, and the universal power of music to bridge generational gaps.
