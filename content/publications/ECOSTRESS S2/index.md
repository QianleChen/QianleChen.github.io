abstract: >
  On July 29, 2025, NASA’s ECOSTRESS instrument captured high-resolution thermal imagery of an active wildfire front near Serabigões in northern Portugal. The data displayed intense land surface temperature gradients, revealing active fire zones exceeding 96°C (206°F) during the heat peak of the day. This visualization has been published on NASA’s ECOSTRESS Gallery.

## Serabigões Wildfire – July 29, 2025

NASA’s **ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station)** recorded high-resolution thermal data of the **Serabigões fire front** in northern Portugal.  
The thermal map captured **land surface temperatures from 26.7°C (80°F) to 96.7°C (206°F)**, identifying multiple active burn zones during a critical afternoon period under extreme heat and dry conditions.

This segment of the **Severe Fire Complex** affected rural areas around Serabigões and surrounding hills, continuing through late July. The dataset supports **fire behavior analysis, damage assessment, and emergency response coordination**.

The visualization was created in collaboration with **Dr. Joshua R. Fisher (Chapman University)** and **Bill Chen (Arnold O. Beckman High School)** and has been **published in the NASA ECOSTRESS Gallery**.
