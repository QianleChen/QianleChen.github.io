abstract: >
  On September 15, 2024, NASA’s ECOSTRESS instrument captured detailed thermal imagery of the Airport Fire spanning Orange and Riverside Counties, Southern California. The thermal data revealed surface temperatures up to 177°F (77°C) across multiple burn zones influenced by Santa Ana winds. The visualization was published in NASA’s ECOSTRESS Gallery.

## Airport Fire – September 15, 2024

NASA’s **ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station)** recorded **thermal imagery of the Airport Fire** during its active expansion across **Orange and Riverside Counties**, Southern California.  
At 1:03 AM PST, ECOSTRESS detected **land surface temperatures from 62°F (17°C) in unburned regions** to **177°F (77°C)** in active burn zones, highlighting two intense fire clusters moving under **Santa Ana wind** conditions.

The **Airport Fire** ignited on **September 9, 2024**, due to equipment use during vegetation clearance, and spread rapidly through rugged terrain and dry vegetation. It was fully contained on **October 5, 2024**, after burning more than **23,526 acres (9,521 ha)**. ECOSTRESS data provided valuable insights into **fire spread, intensity patterns, and thermal behavior** for post-event analysis.

This visualization was created by **Bill Chen (Arnold O. Beckman High School)** in collaboration with **Dr. Joshua R. Fisher (Chapman University)** and has been **published in NASA’s ECOSTRESS Gallery**.
