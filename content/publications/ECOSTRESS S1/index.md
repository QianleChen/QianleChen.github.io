abstract: >
  On July 29, 2025, NASA’s ECOSTRESS mission captured high-resolution thermal imagery of multiple wildfires in northern Portugal. The data revealed extreme heat signatures exceeding 240°F across fire fronts near Bemposta, Ermida, and Marmotos. This visualization was created in collaboration with Dr. Joshua R. Fisher and published on NASA’s ECOSTRESS Gallery.

## Portugal Wildfires – July 29, 2025

NASA’s **ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station)** recorded thermal anomalies during the 2025 Portugal wildfires.  
The dataset shows **land surface temperatures exceeding 111°C (242°F)** across multiple fronts in the northern region. These measurements provided key insights into **fire intensity, spread, and local impacts**, supporting environmental monitoring and emergency response.

This visualization was produced in collaboration with **Dr. Joshua Fisher (Chapman University)**, and has been **published in the NASA ECOSTRESS Gallery** for public access.
