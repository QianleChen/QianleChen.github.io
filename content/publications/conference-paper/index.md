## Abstract

This project tests whether NASA ECOSTRESS evapotranspiration (ET) can track plant water
status across species and sites. ECOSTRESS ET was paired with PSInet predawn and midday
leaf water potentials within seven days. Lower ET aligned with more negative water potentials,
with significant correlations for 9 of 26 species at midday and 7 of 28 at predawn. Effect sizes
varied by functional traits and site, suggesting that ECOSTRESS ET provides a scalable,
non-invasive indicator of plant drought stress that complements field measurements and
management decisions.

## Poster Presentation

This research was **presented at the 2025 NASA ECOSTRESS Annual Science Team Meeting**.  
Highlighting the integration of satellite-derived evapotranspiration data with field-measured
leaf water potentials to assess drought stress at a global scale.  
The poster summarizes cross-species analyses showing significant relationships between
ECOSTRESS-derived evapotranspiration and plant water potential.
