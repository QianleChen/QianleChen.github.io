## Abstract

This project tests whether NASA ECOSTRESS evapotranspiration (ET) can track plant water
status across species and sites. ECOSTRESS ET was paired with PSInet predawn and midday
leaf water potentials within seven days. Lower ET aligned with more negative water potentials,
with significant correlations for 9 of 26 species at midday and 7 of 28 at predawn. Effect sizes
varied by functional traits and site, suggesting that ECOSTRESS ET provides a scalable,
non-invasive indicator of plant drought stress that complements field measurements and
management decisions.
