abstract: >
  On October 29, 2020, NASA’s ECOSTRESS instrument captured high-resolution thermal imagery of the Silverado Fire burning in Orange County, California. The thermal data revealed temperature contrasts between cool, unaffected areas and active fire cores reaching 176°F (80°C). The visualization highlights the role of ECOSTRESS in wildfire monitoring and was published in NASA’s ECOSTRESS Gallery.

## Silverado Fire – October 29, 2020

NASA’s **ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station)** captured high-resolution land surface temperature data of the **Silverado Fire** across Orange County, California.  
At 6:21 PM PST, ECOSTRESS recorded temperatures ranging from **68°F (20°C)** in unaffected terrain to **176°F (80°C)** in the most intense fire zones, revealing multiple high-temperature cores and the fire’s spread through canyon foothills under **Santa Ana wind conditions**.

The **Silverado Fire** began on October 26, 2020, and was fully contained by November 7 after burning more than **12,466 acres (5,046 ha)**. ECOSTRESS imagery provided valuable insight for emergency coordination and scientific analysis of **fire behavior, drought stress, and post-fire recovery**.

The visualization was created by **Bill Chen (Arnold O. Beckman High School)** in collaboration with **Dr. Joshua R. Fisher (Chapman University)** and has been **published in NASA’s ECOSTRESS Gallery**.
