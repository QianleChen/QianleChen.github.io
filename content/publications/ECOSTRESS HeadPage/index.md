abstract: >
  NASA’s ECOSTRESS instrument, mounted on the International Space Station, captured high-resolution thermal imagery of an active wildfire front in the Aude department of southern France on August 6, 2025. The product was featured on the NASA homepage for over a month in recognition of its scientific and operational value. The imagery revealed surface temperature variations across the burn area and was used as a critical situational resource by the France Fire Department and regional emergency teams to understand fire intensity, spread, and local environmental conditions.

## NASA’s ECOSTRESS Wildfire Observation Featured on NASA Homepage

For **over a month**, NASA highlighted this ECOSTRESS product on its public homepage to recognize its value in **real-time wildfire monitoring** and **international emergency response**.

On **August 6, 2025**, the ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station) instrument acquired **high-resolution thermal imagery** of an **active wildfire front** in the **Aude department of southern France**. The imagery showed land surface temperatures during a peak growth phase of the fire, with values ranging from elevated background temperatures to very hot active-fire pixels.

Because ECOSTRESS can measure **land surface temperature and plant stress from the International Space Station**, these data were shared as a **critical reference layer** for the **France Fire Department** and regional incident teams. The product supported:

- Rapid assessment of **where the fire was hottest**  
- Better understanding of **fire behavior across mixed terrain**  
- Communication of **fireline location and severity** to decision makers  
- Broader demonstration of **space-based thermal data for disaster management**

This feature also illustrated ECOSTRESS’s broader mission: using thermal imaging to track **water stress, agricultural impacts, urban heat, and extreme events** from space.

> **Why It Was Recognized**
>
> - Placed on the **NASA homepage for >1 month** as an example of actionable Earth-observing science  
> - Demonstrated **ISS-based thermal sensing** for an **ongoing** emergency, not just retrospective science  
> - Created in collaboration with **NASA JPL**, **ECOSTRESS science team**, and a student contributor from **Arnold O. Beckman High School**
