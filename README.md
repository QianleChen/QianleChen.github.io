## 👋 About Me

I'm a high school senior and aspiring environmental scientist conducting research at UCLA's Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering (JIFRESSE). My work focuses on:

- 🔥 **Wildfire & Climate Research** - Analyzing thermal satellite imagery to study wildfire progression and urban heat patterns (featured in NASA's Caltech JPL ECOSTRESS gallery)
- 🤖 **AI for Emergency Response** - Coordinating a $1M research project with Orange County Fire Department to develop AI-based decision-support models
- 🌱 **Environmental Stewardship** - Founder & President of Harmony with Nature, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit engaging 300+ participants in sustainability education and conservation
- 📊 **IoT & Data Science** - Developed an air quality monitoring system with Python analytics and mobile app deployment

I'm passionate about applying remote sensing, GIS, and data science to address environmental challenges while bridging research and community action.
